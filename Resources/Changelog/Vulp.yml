        Added multiple brick walls for building. Currently they require steel to
        be constructed, but that may change in the future.

        There is now a 256m range restriction on planets. Ahelp if you need that
        range increased.

      message: >-
        Random artifact, gas leak, and random variation (random trash and
        puddles) events should now correctly work planetside instead of spawning
        everything at (0, 0)
    - type: Tweak
      message: >-
        The gas leak event can no longer create tritium or frezon, but in turn
        lasts a lot longer.

      message: NPCs should no longer stop moving when the NPC update limit is reached.

        Merged some upstream changes. See the floofstation changelog for more
        details. Most notably, radios now function similarly to intercoms: you
        can toggle their mic and their speaker.

        NPCs will now retaliate when attacked even if the attacker belongs to a
        faction they are friendly to. This means that animal friend trait users
        can ***no longer*** safely kill vent critters (though they can still
        move them to a spot where they won't hurt anyone).

        Added a new starting map - Tradepost. This one requires at least 6
        online people to vote for and heavily relies on the presence of command
        or cargo+engi members.
    - type: Tweak
      message: >-
        Command members (and anyone else with orders access) can now access

        There is now a weather cycle on planets. Make sure to wear a coat when

        Rainy weather can now clean puddles, and certain weathers can now add
        reagents to open liquid containers. Put that potassium bucket away!

        The weather volume should now properly and automatically adjust based on
        how many weathered tiles there are around the player.
